# Mushroom Classification Project
**Overview :**
    This project aims to classify mushrooms into edible or poisonous categories based on various attributes. It uses machine learning algorithms to make predictions and evaluate their performance.

**Dataset :**
    We used the "agaricus-lepiota.data.txt" dataset for this project. This dataset contains information about various attributes of mushrooms and whether they are edible or poisonous. The dataset is preprocessed to convert categorical data into numerical format for machine learning.

**Prerequisites :**
Before running the project, you'll need the following:
    1. Python (3.x recommended)
    2. Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
    3. Required Python libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, xgboost)
